Kleap uses advanced AI models to understand your requests and generate code.

## How Kleap Uses AI

When you send a message, Kleap:

1. **Understands** your intent and context
2. **Plans** the changes needed
3. **Generates** high-quality code
4. **Applies** changes to your app
5. **Verifies** the result works

## AI Capabilities

### What AI Does Best

- **UI Creation** - Turning descriptions into beautiful interfaces
- **CRUD Operations** - Database interactions and forms
- **Authentication** - User login and signup flows
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Common Patterns** - Standard web app features

### What Requires More Guidance

- **Complex Business Logic** - Be specific about rules
- **Custom Algorithms** - Provide clear requirements
- **Unique Designs** - Reference examples or provide details
- **Integration Edge Cases** - Specify expected behaviors

## Prompt Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific

```
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Increase the heading size to 3xl and add more padding around the cards"
```

### Provide Context

```
❌ "Add a button"
✅ "Add a 'Save Draft' button next to the existing 'Publish' button that saves the post without publishing"
```

### Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of:
```
Build a complete e-commerce checkout with cart, shipping, and payment
```

Try:
```
1. "Create a shopping cart component showing items and total"
2. "Add a shipping address form"
3. "Integrate Stripe checkout"
```

## Code Quality

AI-generated code follows best practices:

| Aspect | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 with App Router |
| **Language** | TypeScript with proper types |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS utilities |
| **Components** | shadcn/ui component library |
| **Structure** | Component-based architecture |
| **Accessibility** | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels |

## Context Understanding

The AI understands:

- **Your entire codebase** - Existing components and patterns
- **Selected elements** - What you clicked in the preview
- **Conversation history** - Previous messages in the session
- **Project structure** - File organization and imports

<Info>
  The more you build, the better the AI understands your project's patterns and preferences.
</Info>

## Token Usage

Each message uses tokens (similar to words):

- **Input tokens** - Your message and context
- **Output tokens** - AI's response and code

### Optimizing Token Usage

- Be concise but specific
- Use element selection to provide context
- Reference existing components by name
- Break large tasks into smaller messages

## AI Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

### Knowledge Cutoff

The AI's training data has a cutoff date. For very recent:
- Library versions
- API changes
- New features

Provide documentation links or examples if needed.

### Context Window

Very large projects may exceed context limits. If this happens:
- Focus on specific files
- Reference components by name
- Break work into sessions

### Non-Deterministic Output

AI may generate slightly different code for the same prompt. This is normal. If you need specific output:
- Be more precise in your request
- Provide examples of desired format
- Use element selection for context

## Privacy & Security

### Your Code

- Code is sent to AI for processing
- Not used to train future models
- Processed securely via encrypted connections

### Sensitive Data

<Warning>
  Never include API keys, passwords, or secrets in prompts. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

## Improving Results

### If AI Gets It Wrong

1. **Clarify** - Rephrase with more detail
2. **Correct** - Point out what's wrong
3. **Example** - Show what you expect
4. **Undo** - Use version history to roll back

### Iteration Tips

```
"That's close, but change the button color to blue instead of green"
```

```
"The layout is good, but make the sidebar fixed instead of scrolling"
```

```
"Undo that last change and instead..."
```
