# GitHub Integration

Push your Kleap app code to GitHub for version control, backup, and collaboration.

## Why GitHub?

- **Version control** - Track every change with Git
- **Backup** - Code stored safely in the cloud
- **Collaboration** - Work with developers
- **CI/CD** - Trigger deployments from commits
- **Portability** - Take your code anywhere

## Connecting GitHub

### One-Time Setup

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Click **Connect GitHub**
3. Authorize Kleap in the popup
4. Select repositories access

### Permissions Requested

- Read your profile
- Create repositories
- Push to repositories
- Read repository contents

<Info>
  We only access repositories you explicitly connect. Your other repos remain private.
</Info>

## Pushing Code to GitHub

### Create New Repository

1. Open your app
2. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
3. Click **Create Repository**
4. Enter repository name
5. Choose public or private
6. Click **Create & Push**

### Connect Existing Repository

1. Open your app
2. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
3. Click **Connect Repository**
4. Select from your repositories
5. Confirm connection

<Warning>
  Connecting to an existing repo will overwrite its contents. Make sure it's empty or a backup exists.
</Warning>

## Syncing Changes

### Push to GitHub

After making changes in Kleap:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Click **Push Changes**
3. Enter a commit message (optional)
4. Changes are pushed to your repo

### Auto-Push

Enable automatic syncing:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Toggle **Auto-push on publish**
3. Every publish also pushes to GitHub

## Repository Structure

Your GitHub repo contains the full Next.js project:

```
your-app/
├── app/                  # Pages and routes
├── components/           # React components
├── lib/                  # Utilities
├── public/               # Static assets
├── styles/               # CSS files
├── package.json          # Dependencies
├── next.config.js        # Next.js config
├── tailwind.config.ts    # Tailwind config
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript config
```

## Working with Developers

### Share with a Developer

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Share the repository URL
3. Developer clones and runs locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/your-app
cd your-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Merge Developer Changes

When a developer pushes changes:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Click **Pull Changes**
3. Changes are synced to Kleap

<Info>
  Manual merges may be needed if both sides have changes. Advanced Git knowledge helps here.
</Info>

## Branches

### Default Branch

Kleap works with your default branch (usually `main` or `master`).

### Feature Branches

For experimental changes:

1. Developer creates branch locally
2. Makes changes and commits
3. Creates pull request
4. Merge to main when ready
5. Pull changes into Kleap

## GitHub Actions

Your repository can use GitHub Actions for:

- **Automated testing** - Run tests on push
- **Code quality** - Lint and format checks
- **Deployment** - Deploy on merge to main

### Example Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build
```

## Private vs Public

| Type | Visibility | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Private** | Only you and collaborators | Client projects, proprietary code |
| **Public** | Anyone can view | Open source, portfolios |

## Disconnecting GitHub

To disconnect:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Click **Disconnect**

Your repository remains on GitHub. Only the Kleap connection is removed.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Push failed">
    - Check your GitHub connection is active
    - Ensure you have write access to the repo
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Merge conflicts">
    - Pull changes before pushing
    - Resolve conflicts manually if needed
    - Consider using a developer for complex merges
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Repository not showing">
    - Ensure you granted access during OAuth
    - Go to GitHub settings and update Kleap's permissions
    - Try reconnecting your account
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Large files rejected">
    - GitHub has a 100MB file limit
    - Use Git LFS for large assets
    - Consider using a CDN for large images/videos
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
