## How Integrations Work

### One-Time Setup

Most integrations require a one-time OAuth connection:

1. Click **Connect** for the service
2. Authorize Kleap in the service's popup
3. Connection is saved to your account
4. Use across all your apps

### Per-App Configuration

Some integrations need app-specific setup:

- **Supabase** - Each app can have its own database
- **Custom domains** - Configured per published app
- **Environment variables** - Set per app

## Integration Status

Check your connected integrations:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. View connection status for each service
3. Reconnect or disconnect as needed

## Available Integrations

| Service | Purpose | Setup |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Vercel** | Hosting & deployment | Auto-connected |
| **GitHub** | Code repository | One-time OAuth |
| **Supabase** | Database & auth | One-time OAuth + per-app |
