# Vercel Integration

Vercel is the deployment platform for Kleap apps, providing instant global hosting.

## Why Vercel?

Vercel is the company behind Next.js (the framework Kleap apps use):

- **Global CDN** - Fast loading from anywhere
- **Automatic HTTPS** - Free SSL certificates
- **Edge functions** - Serverless computing
- **Preview deployments** - Test before going live
- **Zero config** - Just works with Next.js

## Connecting Vercel

### First-Time Setup

1. Click **Publish** on any app
2. Click **Connect Vercel Account**
3. Authorize Kleap in the popup
4. Connection saved to your account

<Info>
  You only need to connect once. All your apps can then deploy to Vercel.
</Info>

### What Kleap Gets Access To

- Create and manage projects
- Deploy to your account
- Configure domains
- View deployment logs

We cannot access your billing or other Vercel projects.

## Deploying Apps

### One-Click Deploy

1. Open your app in Kleap
2. Click **Publish**
3. Wait for build (~30-60 seconds)
4. Your app is live!

### What Happens During Deploy

1. Code is sent to Vercel
2. Next.js build runs
3. Assets are optimized
4. App deployed to CDN
5. URL is generated

## Deployment URLs

Every deploy creates a URL:

| Type | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Production** | `app-name.vercel.app` | Main live URL |
| **Preview** | `app-name-git-xyz.vercel.app` | Branch previews |
| **Custom** | `myapp.com` | Your domain |

## Project Settings

### Environment Variables

Set in Kleap and synced to Vercel:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environment**
2. Add your variables
3. Redeploy to apply

### Build Settings

Kleap configures optimal build settings:

- Framework: Next.js
- Build command: `next build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Node.js version: 20.x

## Vercel Features Used
