# Code Editor

While AI handles most code generation, you can view and understand the source code of your app at any time.

## Accessing the Code

### File Browser

Click the **Files** tab in the left sidebar to see:

- All project files
- Folder structure
- File types (tsx, css, json, etc.)

### Viewing Files

Click any file to view its contents:

- Syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Code formatting

## File Structure

A typical Kleap app follows Next.js conventions:

```
├── app/                  # Pages and routes
│   ├── page.tsx         # Homepage
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Root layout
│   └── [routes]/        # Other pages
├── components/          # Reusable components
│   ├── ui/             # UI primitives (shadcn)
│   └── [custom]/       # Your components
├── lib/                 # Utilities
├── public/              # Static assets
├── styles/              # Global styles
└── package.json         # Dependencies
```

## Understanding the Code

### Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Next.js 16** | React framework, routing |
| **TypeScript** | Type-safe JavaScript |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first styling |
| **shadcn/ui** | UI component library |

### Key Files

- `app/page.tsx` - Your homepage
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout (header, footer)
- `components/` - Your custom components
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration

## Editing Code

<Warning>
  Direct code editing is for advanced users. For most changes, use the AI chat instead.
</Warning>

### When to Edit Directly

- Fixing typos in text
- Minor CSS adjustments
- Understanding how something works
- Debugging issues

### How to Edit

1. Open the file in the editor
2. Make your changes
3. Save (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
4. Preview updates automatically

## Working with AI

The AI can reference specific files:

```
Look at app/page.tsx and move the hero section
above the features section
```

```
In components/Header.tsx, change the logo size
```

```
Update the color scheme in tailwind.config.ts
```

## Exporting Code

### Push to GitHub

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create or connect a repository
4. Push your code

### Download Files

1. Go to **Settings** > **Export**
2. Click **Download ZIP**
3. Get all source files locally

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Let AI handle complex changes">
    For anything beyond simple text edits, describe what you want in chat. AI understands the full context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use version history">
    If you break something, use [version history](/features/version-history) to roll back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learn the patterns">
    Review AI-generated code to learn Next.js and React patterns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Code Quality

AI-generated code follows best practices:

- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility standards
- Performance optimization
