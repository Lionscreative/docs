Every Kleap app is built on a modern, production-ready foundation.

## Technology Stack

When you create an app, you get:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Next.js 16** | React framework with App Router |
| **TypeScript** | Type-safe code |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first styling |
| **shadcn/ui** | Professional component library |
| **Supabase** | Database, auth, and storage |

## Building with AI

Instead of modifying template code manually, you describe what you want:

### Create Components

```
Add a pricing section with three tiers:
Free, Pro, and Enterprise
```

### Add Features

```
Add user authentication with
Google login and email signup
```

### Style Changes

```
Change the color scheme to blue
with a modern, clean design
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple">
    Begin with a basic description, then add features incrementally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    The more detail you provide, the better the AI understands your vision.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate">
    Build in small steps. Test each change before moving on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customization

Everything is customizable via AI:

- **Layout** - Page structure, navigation, sections
- **Styling** - Colors, fonts, spacing, animations
- **Components** - Forms, tables, cards, modals
- **Features** - Auth, database, payments, APIs
