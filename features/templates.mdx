## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the closest match">
    Choose a template that matches your overall structure, even if the content is different. It's easier to change text and colors than layout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep what works">
    Don't remove everything. Templates have tested designs and patterns. Keep the good parts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mobile-first changes">
    When customizing, check mobile view regularly. Templates are responsive, but your changes might need adjustments.
