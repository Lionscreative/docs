Every Kleap app starts from a pre-configured Next.js foundation that's ready to customize with AI.

## How It Works

When you create a new app, Kleap sets up:

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **Supabase** integration ready

## Building Your App

Instead of choosing from pre-made templates, you describe what you want to build:

```
Create a SaaS landing page with pricing section,
features grid, and signup form
```

```
Build a dashboard with sidebar navigation,
user profile, and data tables
```

```
Make an e-commerce product page with
image gallery, reviews, and add to cart
```

The AI generates exactly what you need, customized to your requirements.
