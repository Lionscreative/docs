---

The live preview shows your app running in real-time. Every change you make appears instantly.

## How It Works

Your app runs in a cloud sandbox (powered by Daytona) that:

- **Hot reloads** when code changes
- **Persists state** during your session
- **Runs real Next.js** - same as production

## Preview Panel

The preview panel on the right side of the editor shows:

- Your running application
- Real-time updates as you code
- Interactive elements (click, type, navigate)

### Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Refresh** | Reload the preview |
| **Open in new tab** | View in full browser window |
| **Device toggle** | Switch between desktop/tablet/mobile |
| **URL bar** | Navigate to different pages |

## Auto-Stop Behavior

<Warning>
  The preview automatically stops after **15 minutes of inactivity** to save resources.
</Warning>

### Restarting the Preview

When stopped, restart by:

1. **Send a new message** - Any chat interaction restarts it
2. **Click Refresh** - In the preview panel
3. **Navigate to the app** - From the apps list

### Session State

When the preview restarts:

- Code changes are preserved
- Database data persists (Supabase)
- Local state/session resets

## Preview URL

Your preview runs at a temporary URL:

```
https://3000-[sandbox-id].proxy.daytona.works
```

<Info>
  This URL is temporary and requires authentication. For permanent, shareable URLs, [publish your app](/features/publishing).
</Info>

## Testing Your App

- Click buttons and links

## Performance
