title: "Element Selection"
description: "Click on any element to select and edit it"
---

Element selection lets you click on any part of your app to select it, then make changes through the AI chat.

## How It Works

1. **Click** on any element in the preview
2. The element gets **highlighted** with a blue border
3. The AI knows **what you selected**
4. **Ask for changes** - "Make this bigger", "Change the color"

## Selecting Elements

### Single Element

Click directly on the element you want to modify:

- Text blocks
- Buttons
- Images
- Containers
- Forms
- Navigation items

### Visual Feedback

When selected:

- **Blue border** shows the selected element
- **Element info** appears (tag, class)
- The AI references this element in responses

## Making Changes

Once selected, describe your change:

### Styling

```
Make this text larger
```

```
Change the background color to blue
```

```
Add more padding around this section
```

### Content

```
Change this heading to "Welcome to My App"
```

```
Replace this image with a placeholder
```

### Layout

```
Center this content
```

```
Make this a 3-column grid
```

### Functionality

```
Make this button open a modal
```

```
Add a click animation to this card
```

## Tips for Better Selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be precise with clicks">
    Click directly on the element you want. If you hit a parent container, try clicking closer to the content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptions when selection is tricky">
    If clicking doesn't select the right element:
    ```
    The third button in the navigation bar
    ```
    ```
    The hero section heading
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reference multiple elements">
    You can describe multiple elements:
    ```
    Make all buttons in this section rounded
    ```
    ```
    Change the color of all headings to blue
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

- Some deeply nested elements may be harder to select
- Dynamic elements (modals, dropdowns) need to be visible to select
- For complex selections, describe the element in chat

## Without Selection

You can still make changes without selection by being descriptive:

```
Change the main heading on the homepage to "Welcome"
```

```
Update the footer background to dark gray
```

```
Make all buttons have rounded corners
```
