Give your app a professional identity by connecting your own domain.

<Info>
  Custom domains are available on **Pro plans and above**. [Upgrade to Pro](/features/overview) to unlock this feature.
</Info>

## Domain Options

### Kleap Subdomain (Free)

Every published app gets a free URL:

```
https://your-app-name.kleap.io
```

### Custom Domain (Pro)

Connect your own domain:

```
https://myapp.com
https://app.mycompany.com
```

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Get a Domain

You can purchase a domain directly in Kleap (Settings > Domain > Buy New), or use one you already own from:

- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
- [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)

### Step 2: Add Domain in Kleap

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domain**
2. Choose **Buy New**, **Transfer**, or **Connect Existing**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `myapp.com`)
4. Copy the DNS records shown

### Step 3: Configure DNS

Add an **A record** at your domain registrar pointing to Kleap's server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Root Domain (myapp.com)">
    | Type | Name | Value |
    |------|------|-------|
    | A | @ | 20.56.72.69 |
    | A | www | 20.56.72.69 |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subdomain (app.myapp.com)">
    | Type | Name | Value |
    |------|------|-------|
    | A | app | 20.56.72.69 |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Kleap only supports **A records**. Do not use CNAME records for your root domain.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Using Cloudflare?** Set the proxy status to **DNS only** (grey cloud icon, not orange). The Cloudflare proxy blocks SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt. See the [Cloudflare section](#domain-with-cloudflare) below for details.
</Info>

### Step 4: Verify

1. Return to Kleap settings
2. Kleap automatically checks your DNS every 10 seconds
3. Once detected, your SSL certificate is provisioned automatically

<Info>
  DNS changes typically take a few minutes to 48 hours to propagate worldwide.
</Info>

## SSL Certificates

Kleap automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt:

- **Free SSL** - Included with all custom domains
- **Auto-renewal** - Certificates renew automatically
- **HTTPS enforced** - HTTP redirects to HTTPS

## Multiple Domains

You can connect multiple domains to one app:

- `myapp.com` (primary)
- `www.myapp.com` (alias)
- `app.mycompany.com` (alias)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain not verifying">
    - Double-check the A record points to `20.56.72.69`
    - Wait up to 48 hours for propagation
    - Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify
    - Ensure no conflicting A or CNAME records exist for the same name
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate not issued">
    - DNS must resolve to `20.56.72.69` first
    - If using Cloudflare, make sure proxy is **OFF** (grey cloud / DNS only)
    - Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS propagation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="www not working">
    Add an A record for `www` pointing to `20.56.72.69`, same as the root domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redirect loop">
    - If using Cloudflare, disable the proxy (set to DNS only / grey cloud)
    - Make sure you don't have conflicting CNAME and A records
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Domain with Cloudflare

If using Cloudflare as your DNS provider:

1. Add an **A record** pointing to `20.56.72.69`
2. Set proxy status to **DNS only** (grey cloud icon)
3. Wait for the SSL certificate to be issued (usually under 10 minutes)

<Warning>
  **Do not enable the Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud)** when first setting up your domain. The proxy blocks SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt. You can re-enable it after your site is live, but DNS only mode is recommended.
</Warning>

## Removing a Domain

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domain**
2. Click the trash icon next to the domain
3. Confirm removal
4. Update or remove DNS records at your registrar

  <Card title="Use subdomains for apps" icon="sitemap">
    Keep `mycompany.com` for your main site, use `app.mycompany.com` for the Kleap app.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set up www" icon="arrow-right">
    Add an A record for both `@` and `www` to cover both variants.
