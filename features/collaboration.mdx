  </Card>
  <Card title="Use version history" icon="clock-rotate-left">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Avoiding Conflicts

Currently, Kleap doesn't have real-time collaboration (like Google Docs). To avoid conflicts:

1. **Communicate** when you're working on the app
2. **Work on different parts** at the same time
3. **Refresh** before starting to get latest changes
4. **Use version history** to recover if needed

## Team Billing

### Credit Usage

- Each edit uses credits from the **app owner's** account
- Team members don't need their own credits to edit
- Owner can view credit usage per team member

### Pro Team Features

On Pro and Business plans:

- More team members allowed
- Priority support for all members

## Limits

| Plan | Team Members per App |
|------|---------------------|
