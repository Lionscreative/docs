The AI Chat is your main interface for building apps with Kleap. Simply describe what you want, and the AI generates the code.

## How It Works

1. **Describe your request** in the chat input
2. **AI processes** your request and generates code
3. **Preview updates** in real-time
4. **Iterate** by sending follow-up messages

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ```
    Create a contact form with fields for name, email,
    and message. Add a submit button that shows a
    success toast when clicked.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Too Vague">
    ```
    Add a form
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Include Context

Tell the AI where and how:

```
Add a testimonials section to the homepage, below
the features section. Use a carousel with 3 cards
showing customer photos, names, and quotes.
```

### Reference Existing Elements

```
Change the header background to match the footer color
```

```
Make the pricing cards look like the feature cards above
```

## Example Prompts

### Creating Components

```
Create a pricing table with 3 tiers: Free, Pro, and
Enterprise. Include feature lists and CTA buttons.
```

### Styling Changes

```
Make the hero section full-height with a gradient
background from purple to blue
```

### Adding Functionality

```
Add user authentication with email/password login
and a sign-up form
```

### Fixing Issues

```
The button on mobile is too small. Increase the
padding and font size on screens below 768px
```

## Chat Features

### Message History

Your conversation is saved automatically. Scroll up to see previous messages and the AI's responses.

### Regenerate Response

If you're not happy with a response, you can ask the AI to try again:

```
That's not quite right. Can you try a different approach?
```

### Credit Usage

Each message consumes credits based on complexity:

| Request Type | Typical Cost |
|--------------|--------------|
| Simple styling change | 1-3 credits |
| New component | 5-15 credits |
| Full page/feature | 20-50 credits |

<Info>
  You can see your remaining credits in the top navigation bar.

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Break complex requests into steps">
    Instead of asking for an entire app at once, build incrementally:
    1. "Create the homepage layout"
    2. "Add a navigation header"
    3. "Create the hero section"
    4. "Add the features grid"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reference design systems">
    Mention styles you like:
    - "Use a clean, minimal design like Linear"
    - "Make it colorful and playful like Notion"
    - "Professional and corporate like Stripe"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide examples">
    Share references:
    - "Similar to how Airbnb shows listings"
    - "Like a Trello board layout"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate in small steps">
    Make one change at a time for precise control:
    - "Increase the heading size"
    - "Add more spacing between sections"
    - "Change the button color to green"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

<Warning>
  If the AI seems stuck or gives unexpected results:
  1. Be more specific in your request
  2. Break it into smaller steps
  3. Reference specific files or components
  4. Refresh and try again
</Warning>
