Publish your app to get a permanent, always-online production URL.

## One-Click Publishing

Publishing your app is simple:

1. Click **Publish** in the top toolbar
2. Wait for build to complete (~30-60 seconds)
3. Your app is live!

<Info>
  Publishing doesn't consume credits. Hosting is included with your Kleap account.
</Info>

## Your Production URL

After publishing, you get a permanent URL:

```
https://your-app-name.kleap.co
```

This URL:

- Is **always online** (24/7)
- Is **publicly accessible**
- Supports **HTTPS** automatically
- Can be **shared** with anyone

## Preview vs Production

| Aspect | Preview | Production |
|--------|---------|------------|
| URL | `3000-xxx.proxy.daytona.works` | `your-app.kleap.co` |
| Uptime | During editing | 24/7 |
| Access | Requires login | Public |
| Performance | Development mode | Optimized |
| Purpose | Building/testing | Live users |

## Updating Your App

After initial publish:

1. Make changes in Kleap
2. Click **Publish** again
3. New version goes live instantly

<Tip>
  Each publish creates a new version. Your changes are deployed within seconds.
</Tip>

## Build Settings

Kleap handles build configuration automatically:

- Next.js output optimized
- Images compressed
- Code minified
- Assets cached on global CDN

## Deployment Status

Track your deployment:

- **Building** - Code is compiling
- **Deploying** - Uploading to servers
- **Ready** - Live and accessible
- **Error** - Build failed (check logs)

### Viewing Logs

If deployment fails:

1. Click the deployment status
2. View build logs
3. Check for errors
4. Fix issues and redeploy

## Environment Variables

For apps needing secrets (API keys):

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environment**
2. Add variables (KEY=value)
3. They're injected at build time

<Warning>
  Never put secrets in your code. Use environment variables for API keys, database URLs, etc.
</Warning>

## Unpublishing

To take your app offline:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Unpublish**
3. Your app is no longer accessible

<Info>
  Unpublishing doesn't delete your app. You can republish anytime.
</Info>
