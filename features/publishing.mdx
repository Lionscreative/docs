Publish your app to Vercel for a permanent, always-online production deployment.

## Why Vercel?

Kleap deploys to **Vercel**, the company behind Next.js:

- **Global CDN** - Fast loading worldwide
- **Automatic HTTPS** - Free SSL certificates
- **Instant deploys** - Go live in seconds
- **Free tier** - Generous limits for most apps

## Publishing Your App

### First-Time Setup

1. Click **Publish** in the top toolbar
2. Connect your **Vercel account** (one-time)
3. Authorize Kleap to deploy

### Deploy

1. Click **Publish**
2. Wait for build to complete (~30-60 seconds)
3. Your app is live!

<Info>
  Publishing doesn't consume credits. Vercel hosting is free within their limits.

## Your Production URL

After publishing, you get a permanent URL:

```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app
```

This URL:

- Is **always online** (24/7)
- Is **publicly accessible**
- Supports **HTTPS** automatically
- Can be **shared** with anyone

## Preview vs Production

| Aspect | Preview | Production |
|--------|---------|------------|
| URL | `3000-xxx.proxy.daytona.works` | `your-app.vercel.app` |
| Uptime | During editing | 24/7 |
| Access | Requires login | Public |
| Performance | Development mode | Optimized |
| Purpose | Building/testing | Live users |

## Updating Your App

After initial publish:

1. Make changes in Kleap
2. Click **Publish** again
3. New version goes live

<Tip>
  Vercel keeps previous deployments. You can roll back from the Vercel dashboard if needed.
</Tip>

## Build Settings

Kleap handles build configuration automatically:

- Next.js output optimized
- Images compressed
- Code minified
- Assets cached

## Deployment Status

Track your deployment:

- **Building** - Code is compiling
- **Deploying** - Uploading to CDN
- **Ready** - Live and accessible
- **Error** - Build failed (check logs)

### Viewing Logs

If deployment fails:

1. Click the deployment status
2. View build logs
3. Check for errors
4. Fix issues and redeploy

## Environment Variables

For apps needing secrets (API keys):

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environment**
2. Add variables (KEY=value)
3. They're injected at build time

<Warning>
  Never put secrets in your code. Use environment variables for API keys, database URLs, etc.
</Warning>
