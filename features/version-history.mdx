description: "Track changes and roll back to previous versions"

Every change to your app is tracked. You can view history and restore any previous version.

## How It Works

Kleap automatically saves a version when:

- You make changes via AI chat
- You edit files directly
- You publish to Vercel

## Viewing History

### Access Version History

1. Click **History** in the top toolbar
2. Or go to **Settings** > **Version History**

### What You'll See

- **Timestamp** - When the change was made
- **Description** - What changed (from chat message)
- **Files changed** - Which files were modified

## Restoring Versions

### Roll Back to a Version

1. Find the version in history
2. Click **Restore this version**
3. Confirm the rollback
4. Your app reverts to that state

<Warning>
  Restoring a version creates a new version with the old code. Your current work is preserved in history.
</Warning>

### Preview Before Restoring

Click on any version to preview what your app looked like at that point.

## Use Cases

### Undo a Bad Change

Made a change that broke something?

1. Open version history
2. Find the version before the change
3. Restore it
4. Try again with a different approach

### Compare Changes

See what changed between versions:

1. Select two versions
2. View the diff (file differences)
3. Understand what was modified

### Recover Lost Work

Accidentally deleted a component?

1. Find when it existed in history
2. Restore that version
3. Or copy just the parts you need

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Make meaningful changes">
    Send clear, specific messages so version descriptions are useful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check history before major changes">
    Before big refactors, note your current version in case you need to roll back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't rely solely on history">
    For important milestones, also push to GitHub for permanent backup.
