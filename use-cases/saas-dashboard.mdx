# Build a SaaS Dashboard

Create a software-as-a-service application with user authentication, dashboard, and subscription billing.

## What We're Building

A project management SaaS with:

- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Dashboard with projects overview
- Project creation and management
- Team collaboration
- Subscription billing with Stripe

## Prerequisites

- Kleap account
- Supabase account (free)
- Stripe account (for payments)

## Step 1: Start with Template

Start with the SaaS template for a head start:

1. Create new app
2. Select **SaaS Template**
3. Name your project

The template includes:
- Authentication setup
- Dashboard layout
- Basic pages

## Step 2: Customize the Landing Page

```
Update the landing page:
- Change the headline to "Project Management Made Simple"
- Update the subheadline to describe project management features
- Modify the feature cards to show: Task Tracking, Team Collaboration, Progress Reports
- Update the pricing section with three tiers: Starter ($9/mo), Pro ($29/mo), Team ($79/mo)
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Database

### Create Tables

```
Create these database tables:

1. projects
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - name (text)
   - description (text)
   - user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
   - created_at (timestamp)

2. tasks
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - title (text)
   - description (text)
   - status (text: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'done')
   - project_id (uuid, references projects)
   - assigned_to (uuid, nullable)
   - due_date (date, nullable)
   - created_at (timestamp)

Add RLS policies so users only see their own projects and tasks.
```

## Step 4: Build the Dashboard

### Projects List

```
Create a projects dashboard that shows:
- Grid of project cards
- Each card shows: name, description preview, task count, last updated
- "New Project" button in the top right
- Empty state if no projects exist
```

### Project Detail Page

```
Create a project detail page at /dashboard/projects/[id] that shows:
- Project name and description at top
- Task list with columns: To Do, In Progress, Done (Kanban style)
- Ability to drag tasks between columns
- Add task button that opens a modal
```

### Create Project Modal

```
Add a "Create Project" modal with:
- Name input (required)
- Description textarea
- Cancel and Create buttons
- Save to database on create
- Redirect to the new project after creation
```

## Step 5: Task Management

### Task Card

```
Create a task card component showing:
- Task title
- Due date (if set)
- Assignee avatar (if assigned)
- Status indicator
- Click to open detail view
```

### Add Task

```
Create an "Add Task" form with:
- Title (required)
- Description
- Due date picker
- Status dropdown
- Save to the project's task list
```

### Task Actions

```
Add task actions:
- Click to edit task details
- Mark as complete (moves to Done column)
- Delete task (with confirmation)
```

## Step 6: Team Features

### Invite Team Members

```
Add team invitation:
- Settings page with "Team" tab
- Invite by email input
- Pending invitations list
- Team member list with remove option
```

### Assign Tasks

```
Update tasks to support assignment:
- Dropdown to select team member
- Show assignee on task card
- Filter tasks by assignee
```

## Step 7: Stripe Integration

### Connect Stripe

1. Get Stripe API keys
2. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
   ```

### Create Subscription Flow

```
Add Stripe subscription:
- Pricing page with plan comparison
- "Subscribe" buttons that create Stripe checkout sessions
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- Update user's plan in database after successful payment
- Show current plan in settings
```

### Manage Subscription

```
Add subscription management:
- Current plan display
- "Manage Subscription" button that opens Stripe portal
- Cancel subscription option
```

## Step 8: Polish

### Loading States

```
Add loading states:
- Skeleton loaders for project cards
- Loading spinner for task operations
- Disable buttons during async actions
```

### Empty States

```
Add empty states:
- No projects: "Create your first project"
- No tasks: "Add a task to get started"
- No team members: "Invite your team"
```

### Responsive Design

```
Make the dashboard mobile-friendly:
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Stacked layout for task columns
- Touch-friendly interactions
```
