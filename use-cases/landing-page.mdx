# Build a Landing Page

Create a marketing landing page that converts visitors into customers.

## What We're Building

A conversion-focused landing page with:

- Hero section with clear value proposition
- Features/benefits section
- Social proof (testimonials)
- Pricing table
- FAQ section
- Call-to-action sections
- Email signup form

## Step 1: Hero Section

### The Hook

```
Create a hero section with:
- Bold headline that states the main benefit (not features)
- Subheadline that expands on the value
- Primary CTA button (most important action)
- Secondary CTA or link (less commitment option)
- Hero image or product screenshot
- Optional: trust badges or social proof
```

### Example Headlines

Good headlines focus on benefits:

| ❌ Feature-focused | ✅ Benefit-focused |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "AI-Powered Platform" | "Launch Your App 10x Faster" |
| "Team Collaboration Tool" | "Never Miss a Deadline Again" |
| "Email Marketing Software" | "Turn Subscribers into Customers" |

### Hero Styling

```
Style the hero section:
- Large, readable headline (text-5xl or bigger)
- Gradient or bold background
- CTA buttons with strong contrast
- Subtle animation on the image/screenshot
- Responsive for mobile (stack vertically)
```

## Step 2: Social Proof Bar

```
Add a social proof section below the hero:
- Logos of companies using your product, OR
- "Trusted by X,000 users", OR
- Star rating with review count
- Keep it subtle, not overwhelming
```

## Step 3: Features/Benefits Section

```
Create a features section with:
- Section headline: "Everything you need to [achieve goal]"
- 3-4 feature cards in a grid
- Each card: icon, title, brief description
- Focus on benefits, not just features
- Optional: screenshot or illustration for each
```

### Feature Card Example

```
Feature: Automated Reports
Benefit: "Save 5 hours every week with reports that write themselves"
```

## Step 4: How It Works

```
Add a "How It Works" section:
- 3 simple steps
- Each step: number, title, description
- Visual flow (arrows or timeline)
- Ends with CTA button
```

Example:
1. Sign up in 30 seconds
2. Connect your data
3. Get insights automatically

## Step 5: Testimonials

```
Create a testimonials section:
- Section headline: "What Our Customers Say"
- 3 testimonial cards
- Each shows: quote, name, company/role, photo
- Optional: company logo
- Consider a carousel for more testimonials
```

### Getting Testimonials

If you don't have real testimonials yet:
- Use placeholder content
- Add real ones as you get them
- Ask early users for feedback

## Step 6: Pricing Section

```
Create a pricing section with:
- 2-3 pricing tiers in cards
- Highlight the recommended tier
- Each shows: plan name, price, features list, CTA
- Monthly/annual toggle if applicable
- Money-back guarantee badge
```

### Pricing Psychology

- Put recommended plan in the middle
- Use the decoy effect (make middle tier best value)
- List specific features, not vague benefits
- End with FAQ about pricing

## Step 7: FAQ Section

```
Add an FAQ section with:
- Accordion-style Q&A
- 5-8 common questions
- Address objections and concerns
- Include pricing, security, support questions
- Add "Still have questions? Contact us" at the bottom
```

### Common FAQs to Include

- How does pricing work?
- Is there a free trial?
- How is my data secured?
- Can I cancel anytime?
- Do you offer refunds?
- How do I get support?

## Step 8: Final CTA Section

```
Add a final CTA section before the footer:
- Compelling headline: "Ready to [achieve benefit]?"
- Brief reinforcing text
- Primary CTA button (same as hero)
- Trust element (guarantee, testimonial snippet)
```

## Step 9: Email Capture

```
Add an email signup form:
- Can be in hero, floating bar, or dedicated section
- Simple: just email input + button
- Clear value proposition ("Get weekly tips")
- Save emails to Supabase database
```

### Form Implementation

```
Make the email form functional:
- Validate email format
- Check for duplicate submissions
- Save to database
- Show success message
- Send to email service (optional)
```

## Step 10: Footer

```
Create a footer with:
- Company logo
- Navigation links
- Legal links (Privacy, Terms)
- Social media links
- Copyright notice
- Optional: newsletter signup
```

## Step 11: Polish

### Mobile Optimization

```
Ensure mobile-first design:
- Readable text sizes on mobile
- Stacked layouts
- Full-width CTAs
- Easy tap targets
- Fast loading
```

### Performance

```
Optimize for speed:
- Compress and lazy load images
- Minimize JavaScript
- Use Next.js Image component
- Target <3 second load time
```

### SEO

```
Add SEO elements:
- Compelling meta title and description
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Structured data for rich snippets
- Fast loading (affects rankings)
```
