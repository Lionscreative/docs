## Version Numbers

Kleap uses continuous deployment, so we don't have traditional version numbers. Updates are deployed as they're ready, and this changelog reflects significant changes.

## Breaking Changes

We strive to avoid breaking changes. When necessary, they are:

- Announced in advance
- Documented with migration guides
- Rolled out gradually
