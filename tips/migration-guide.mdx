Coming from another AI app builder? Here's how to get started with Kleap.

## From Lovable

Lovable and Kleap are similar in concept. Here's what to know:

### What's the Same

- AI-powered chat interface
- Real-time preview
- Supabase integration
- Vercel deployment
- React/Next.js stack

### Key Differences

| Feature | Lovable | Kleap |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Framework** | Vite + React | Next.js 16 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind | Tailwind + shadcn/ui |
| **Hosting** | Lovable Cloud | Vercel |
| **Sandboxes** | Custom | Daytona |
| **Pricing** | Message-based | Credit-based |

### Migration Steps

1. **Export from Lovable** (if possible) or note down your app's features
2. **Create new Kleap app** from appropriate template
3. **Recreate features** describing them to AI
4. **Connect Supabase** - Same project or new one
5. **Migrate data** if using same Supabase project

### Lovable → Kleap Concepts

| Lovable | Kleap Equivalent |
|---------|------------------|
| Chat | AI Chat |
| Preview | Live Preview |
| Deploy | Publish to Vercel |
| Supabase | Supabase |
| Edge Functions | API Routes + Edge Functions |

## From Bolt.new

Bolt and Kleap both use AI for development.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Bolt | Kleap |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Environment** | StackBlitz | Daytona |
| **Framework** | Various | Next.js |
| **Database** | Manual setup | Supabase built-in |
| **Deployment** | Netlify/Vercel | Vercel |

### Migration Steps

1. **Note your app structure** - Pages, components, features
2. **Create Kleap app** - Start fresh or from template
3. **Describe features** - Tell AI what to build
4. **Set up database** - Connect Supabase
5. **Deploy** - Publish to Vercel

### Code Migration

If you have code from Bolt:

```
I have a React component from another project.
Can you adapt it to work with our Next.js setup?
[paste component code]
```

## From v0 (Vercel)

v0 generates UI components. Kleap builds full apps.

### Differences

| Feature | v0 | Kleap |
|---------|-----|-------|
| **Output** | Components | Full apps |
| **Database** | No | Supabase |
| **Auth** | No | Built-in |
| **Hosting** | Manual | Vercel |
| **Interactivity** | Limited | Full |

### Using v0 Components in Kleap

If you have a v0 component you like:

```
I have this component design from v0.
Can you integrate it into our app?
[paste component code or describe it]
```

Or describe what you saw:

```
Create a pricing table with three tiers, similar to v0's
pricing component style with cards and feature lists
```

## From Custom Code

Have an existing React/Next.js project?

### Manual Migration

1. **Create new Kleap app**
2. **Describe your app** to AI
3. **Copy specific components** you want to keep
4. **Ask AI to adapt** them to Kleap's structure

### Example

```
I have an existing header component. Can you recreate
something similar that matches our app's design?

Features it had:
- Logo on left
- Nav links in center
- User avatar dropdown on right
- Mobile hamburger menu
```

## Data Migration

### Same Supabase Project

If keeping your Supabase project:

1. Connect the same Supabase project in Kleap
2. Your data is instantly available
3. Update queries if schema changed

### New Supabase Project

If creating new database:

1. **Export data** from old project (CSV/JSON)
2. **Create tables** in new Supabase
3. **Import data** via Supabase dashboard
4. **Update RLS policies**

## Feature Parity Checklist

When migrating, ensure you recreate:

- [ ] All pages and routes
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] API integrations
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] Forms and validation
- [ ] File uploads (if any)
- [ ] Payment integration (if any)

## Tips for Smooth Migration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start fresh when possible">
    It's often faster to rebuild than migrate complex code. AI can recreate features quickly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document what you have">
    Before migrating, write down all features, pages, and integrations. Use this as a checklist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Migrate incrementally">
    Don't try to recreate everything at once. Build core features first, then add more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep old app running">
    Keep your old app accessible until the new one is fully tested and deployed.
