# Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to build better apps faster.

## Planning Your App

### Start with a Clear Vision

Before opening Kleap:

1. **Define your goal** - What problem does this app solve?
2. **List core features** - What must it do? (Start with 3-5)
3. **Sketch the flow** - How will users navigate?
4. **Identify data** - What information needs storing?

### Choose the Right Template

Templates give you a head start:

- **SaaS Template** - User auth, dashboard, billing
- **Portfolio** - Personal sites, portfolios
- **Landing Page** - Marketing, product launches
- **E-commerce** - Product sales, checkout

Or start blank if you have a unique idea.

## Building Incrementally

### Small Steps Win

### Recommended Build Order

<Steps>

    Header, footer, navigation structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pages">
    Create main pages with placeholder content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Components">
    Build reusable components (cards, forms, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Styling">
    Refine colors, typography, spacing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data">
    Connect database, add real content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Functionality">
    Add interactions, forms, features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Polish">
    Responsive fixes, loading states, error handling
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Organization

### Let AI Follow Conventions

Kleap uses standard Next.js structure:

```
app/           → Pages and routes
components/    → Reusable components
lib/           → Utility functions
public/        → Static assets
```

Don't fight this structure. Let AI organize code appropriately.

### Component Reusability

Ask for reusable components:

```
"Create a Card component that I can reuse across different
sections with customizable title, description, and icon"
```

Then reference them:

```
"Use the Card component to display the pricing tiers"
```

## Styling Guidelines

### Consistent Design

Establish design tokens early:

```
"Use these colors throughout the app:
- Primary: blue-600
- Secondary: gray-600
- Background: gray-50
- Accent: purple-500"
```

### Mobile First

Always consider mobile:

```
"Make sure this section works well on mobile devices,
with stacked layout and appropriate text sizes"
```

## Database Best Practices

### Plan Your Schema

Before asking AI to create tables:

1. List what data you need
2. Define relationships
3. Consider what queries you'll run

### Enable Security

Always ask for Row Level Security:

```
"Create a posts table and set up RLS so users can only
see and edit their own posts"
```

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Images

```
"Use Next.js Image component for all images with
appropriate sizes and lazy loading"
```

### Minimize Client Components

```
"Make this a server component that fetches data
on the server side"
```

### Add Loading States

```
"Add a loading skeleton while the data is being fetched"
```

## Testing Your App

### Test as You Build

After each change:

1. Check the preview
2. Test on mobile view
3. Click through the flow
4. Look for errors in console

### Test Edge Cases

- Empty states (no data)
- Error states (failed requests)
- Loading states
- Long content
- Many items

## Before Publishing

### Checklist

- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Forms work and validate
- [ ] Mobile layout looks good
- [ ] Links and buttons work
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Auth flow works (if applicable)
- [ ] Database queries work
- [ ] Environment variables set

### Environment Variables

Move all secrets to environment variables:

```
"Move the API key to an environment variable and
update the code to use process.env.API_KEY"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building too much at once">
    Break large features into smaller prompts. Test after each change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ignoring mobile">
    Always test mobile view. Many users browse on phones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hardcoding data">
    Use database or props instead of hardcoded content for dynamic data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skipping error handling">
    Always handle what happens when things fail (no data, API errors).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not using templates">
    Templates save hours of work. Start with one when possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Help

When stuck:

1. **Check the docs** - Answer might be here
2. **Ask AI to explain** - "Why isn't this working?"
3. **Use version history** - Roll back if needed
4. **Join Discord** - Community can help
