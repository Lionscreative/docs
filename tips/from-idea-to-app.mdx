# From Idea to App

A step-by-step guide to taking your idea from concept to launched product.

## Phase 1: Planning

### Define Your Goal

Before opening Kleap, answer:

1. **What problem does this solve?**
2. **Who is it for?**
3. **What are the must-have features?**
4. **What can wait for later?**

### Feature Prioritization

Use the MoSCoW method:

| Priority | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Must Have** | Core functionality that makes it work |
| **Should Have** | Important but not essential at launch |
| **Could Have** | Nice to have if time permits |
| **Won't Have** | Save for future versions |

### Example: Task Manager App

| Priority | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Must Have** | Create tasks, mark complete, delete |
| **Should Have** | Due dates, categories |
| **Could Have** | Reminders, sharing |
| **Won't Have** | Mobile app, integrations |

## Phase 2: Setup

### Choose Your Starting Point

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Template">
    Start with a template if one matches your idea:
    - **SaaS Template** - User auth, dashboard, billing
    - **Landing Page** - Marketing sites
    - **E-commerce** - Product sales
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Start Blank">
    Start from scratch for unique ideas:
    1. Create new app
    2. Choose "Blank" template
    3. Describe your first page
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Initial Prompt

Start with a high-level description:

```
I'm building a task management app for freelancers.
Create the basic structure with:
- A clean landing page
- Navigation with Home, Features, Pricing, Login
- Footer with links and social icons
```

## Phase 3: Build Core Features

### Work in Layers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Layout First">
    Build navigation, footer, page structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pages Next">
    Create main pages with placeholder content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Components">
    Build reusable UI components
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Layer">
    Connect database, define schema
  </Step>
  <Step title="Functionality">
    Add interactions, forms, logic
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Build Sequence

```
1. "Create a dashboard layout with sidebar navigation"

2. "Add a tasks list component showing task name, due date, and status"

3. "Create a Supabase table for tasks with fields: id, title,
   description, due_date, status, user_id"

4. "Connect the tasks list to fetch from the database"

5. "Add a form to create new tasks"

6. "Add the ability to mark tasks as complete"
```

### One Feature at a Time

Don't rush. Complete each feature before moving on:

1. Build it
2. Test it
3. Fix any issues
4. Then move on

## Phase 4: User Authentication

If your app needs users:

```
"Add user authentication with:
- Sign up with email/password
- Login page
- Protect the dashboard route
- Show user's name in the header"
```

### Link Data to Users

Ensure data belongs to users:

```
"Update the tasks table to include user_id and add RLS
policies so users only see their own tasks"
```

## Phase 5: Polish

### Visual Refinement

```
"Improve the overall design:
- Add consistent spacing between sections
- Use a cohesive color palette (blue primary)
- Add hover states to buttons and links
- Ensure good contrast for accessibility"
```

### Responsive Design

```
"Make sure all pages work well on mobile:
- Collapsible navigation
- Stacked layouts on small screens
- Appropriate text sizes"
```

### Loading States

```
"Add loading skeletons while data is being fetched"
```

### Error Handling

```
"Add proper error handling:
- Show error messages if data fails to load
- Validate forms before submission
- Handle network errors gracefully"
```

## Phase 6: Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Forms submit correctly
- [ ] Data saves and loads properly
- [ ] Auth flow works (signup → login → logout)
- [ ] Protected routes redirect properly
- [ ] Mobile layout works
- [ ] All buttons/links work

### Test Edge Cases

- Empty states (no data)
- Long content
- Invalid input
- Slow network
- Different browsers

## Phase 7: Launch Prep

### Environment Variables

Ensure all secrets are in environment variables:

```
"Move any hardcoded API keys to environment variables"
```

### SEO

```
"Add SEO metadata to all pages including title,
description, and Open Graph tags"
```

### Analytics

```
"Add Vercel Analytics to track page views"
```

## Phase 8: Launch

### Deploy to Production

1. Click **Publish**
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Test the live site

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Add domain in settings
2. Configure DNS
3. Wait for SSL certificate

### Announce Your Launch

- Share on social media
- Post on relevant communities
- Tell your network

## Phase 9: Iterate

### Gather Feedback

- Watch how users interact
- Collect feature requests
- Track errors with monitoring

### Plan Next Features

Go back to your "Should Have" list:

```
"Now add due date reminders that notify users
via email one day before"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building too much at once">
    Launch with minimum viable features. You can always add more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not testing enough">
    Test thoroughly before launch. First impressions matter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ignoring mobile">
    Many users browse on phones. Always check mobile layout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skipping auth security">
    Always enable RLS. One security hole can ruin your app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timeline Expectations

A simple app can go from idea to launch in:

- **Landing page**: 1-2 hours
- **Simple app (no auth)**: 2-4 hours
- **App with auth & database**: 4-8 hours
- **Complex app**: Multiple sessions

Build incrementally. Don't rush.
