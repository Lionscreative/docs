# Sandbox Behavior

Your app runs in a cloud sandbox during development. Here's what you need to know.

## What is the Sandbox?

The sandbox is a cloud development environment that:

- Runs your Next.js app in real-time
- Provides instant preview of changes
- Has its own temporary URL
- Includes all necessary dependencies

## Preview URL

During development, your app runs at:

```
https://3000-[sandbox-id].proxy.daytona.works
```

This URL:
- Is temporary (not permanent)
- Requires authentication (tied to your session)
- Is different each session
- Only works while actively editing

<Info>
  For a permanent, public URL, [publish to Vercel](/features/publishing).
</Info>

## Auto-Stop Behavior

### When Does It Stop?

The sandbox automatically stops after **15 minutes of inactivity**.

Inactivity means:
- No messages sent in chat
- No file edits
- No preview interactions tracked

### What Happens When It Stops?

- Preview shows "Sandbox stopped" or fails to load
- Your code is preserved
- Database connections close
- Any in-memory state is lost

### Restarting the Sandbox

Restart by:

1. **Sending any message** - Most common way
2. **Clicking refresh** - In the preview panel
3. **Opening your app** - From the apps list

Restart takes a few seconds. All your code is restored.

## Session vs Persistent State

### Preserved (Always)

- All your code files
- Database data (in Supabase)
- Environment variables
- Version history

### Lost on Restart

- Browser session/cookies
- In-memory application state
- Local storage (in preview)
- Temporary files

## Working Around Auto-Stop

### For Active Development

Keep working - any interaction resets the timer.

### For Testing Flows

If testing requires uninterrupted time:

1. Work in focused sessions
2. Test critical flows quickly
3. Or publish to Vercel for persistent testing

### For Demos

For demos to others, publish to Vercel:

1. Click **Publish**
2. Share the permanent Vercel URL
3. That URL never auto-stops

## Performance Characteristics

### Startup Time

- First start: ~2-5 seconds
- Restart: ~2-3 seconds
- Hot reload: <1 second

### Resource Limits

The sandbox has standard limits:

| Resource | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Memory | 2 GB |
| CPU | Shared |
| Disk | 10 GB |
| Timeout | 15 min idle |

These are sufficient for development and testing.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did my preview stop?">
    It auto-stopped after 15 minutes of no activity. Send a message to restart.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I lose my code?">
    No. Code is saved continuously. Only the running environment stops.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I increase the timeout?">
    Not currently. For persistent hosting, publish to Vercel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my database affected?">
    Supabase database is separate and always available. Only the sandbox stops.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is restart slow sometimes?">
    First restart after a long pause may take a few extra seconds as dependencies are restored.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preview vs Production

| Aspect | Preview (Sandbox) | Production (Vercel) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **URL** | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Uptime** | While editing | 24/7 |
| **Auto-stop** | 15 min idle | Never |
| **Access** | You only | Public |
| **Purpose** | Development | Live users |
| **Speed** | Development mode | Optimized |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Work in sessions" icon="clock">
    Do focused work sessions rather than leaving it idle for hours.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save state to database" icon="database">
    For important state, save to Supabase rather than local storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test critical flows quickly" icon="gauge">
    Test full flows without long pauses in between.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Vercel for demos" icon="rocket">
    Publish to Vercel for reliable demos and sharing.
