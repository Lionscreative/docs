A guide to common error messages and their solutions.

## Build Errors

### Module not found

```
Error: Cannot find module '@/components/Button'
```

**Cause**: The imported file doesn't exist or path is wrong.

**Fix**:
```
The import '@/components/Button' can't be found.
Can you check if the file exists and fix the import path?
```

---

### Unexpected token

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

**Cause**: JavaScript syntax error, often in JSX.

**Fix**:
```
Getting a syntax error "Unexpected token".
Can you find and fix the syntax issue?
```

---

### Type error

```
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

**Cause**: TypeScript type mismatch.

**Fix**:
```
Getting this type error: [full error message]
Can you fix the type issue?
```

---

### Export not found

```
Attempted import error: 'Button' is not exported from './components'
```

**Cause**: Component exists but isn't exported.

**Fix**:
```
The 'Button' component isn't exported properly.
Can you add the export to the component file?
```

## Runtime Errors

### Cannot read properties of undefined

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
```

**Cause**: Trying to use a method on undefined/null value.

**Fix**:
```
Getting "Cannot read properties of undefined" when mapping over data.
Can you add a check for undefined and handle the empty state?
```

---

### X is not a function

```
TypeError: response.json is not a function
```

**Cause**: Variable isn't what you expect.

**Fix**:
```
Getting "[x] is not a function" error.
Can you check the variable type and fix the function call?
```

---

### Network error

```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**Cause**: API request failed (network, CORS, or server error).

**Fix**:
```
API fetch is failing with a network error.
Can you check the API endpoint and error handling?
```

## React/Next.js Errors

### Hydration mismatch

```
Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server
```

**Cause**: Server and client render different content.

**Fix**:
```
Getting a hydration mismatch error.
Can you fix the component to render the same on server and client?
```

Common causes:
- Using `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` directly
- Accessing `window` or `localStorage` without checks
- Conditional rendering based on browser-only values

---

### Invalid hook call

```
Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component
```

**Cause**: Hook used incorrectly.

**Fix**:
```
Getting "Invalid hook call" error.
Can you check that hooks are only used in function components and not inside conditions or loops?
```

---

### Too many re-renders

```
Error: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders
```

**Cause**: Component is in infinite render loop.

**Fix**:
```
Getting "Too many re-renders" error.
Can you find and fix the infinite loop in the component?
```

Usually caused by:
- Calling `setState` directly in render
- Missing dependency array in `useEffect`
- State update triggering another state update

## Database Errors

### RLS policy violation

```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "posts"
```

**Cause**: RLS blocking the operation.

**Fix**:
```
Getting RLS policy violation when [inserting/updating/deleting].
Can you check and fix the RLS policies for this table?
```

---

### Foreign key violation

```
insert or update on table "posts" violates foreign key constraint
```

**Cause**: Referenced record doesn't exist.

**Fix**:
```
Getting foreign key violation error.
The referenced [table] record doesn't exist.
Can you fix the query or create the referenced record first?
```

---

### Duplicate key

```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```

**Cause**: Trying to insert duplicate value in unique column.

**Fix**:
```
Getting duplicate key error.
Can you add a check for existing records or use upsert?
```

## Authentication Errors

### Session not found

```
AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing
```

**Cause**: User not logged in or session expired.

**Fix**:
```
Getting "session missing" error.
Can you add authentication check and redirect to login if not authenticated?
```

---

### Invalid login credentials

```
AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials
```

**Cause**: Wrong email or password.

**Fix**: This is expected for wrong credentials. Ensure your error handling shows a user-friendly message.

## Environment Variable Errors

### Missing environment variable

```
Error: Missing environment variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
```

**Cause**: Required variable not set.

**Fix**:
1. Go to Settings > Environment
2. Add the missing variable
3. Redeploy if in production
