# Prompting Best Practices

Master these techniques to get the most out of Kleap's AI.

## Plan Before Prompting

Before writing, think about:

1. **What** do you want to build?
2. **How** should it look and behave?
3. **Where** should it go in your app?
4. **What** existing elements does it interact with?

## Break Down Complex Tasks

Large requests often fail. Instead, break them into steps:

### ❌ Too Much at Once

```
Build a complete e-commerce site with product listings, shopping cart,
checkout, user accounts, order history, and admin dashboard
```

### ✅ Step by Step

```
Step 1: "Create a product listing page with a grid of product cards
showing image, name, price, and 'Add to Cart' button"

Step 2: "Add a shopping cart sidebar that shows added items and
calculates the total"

Step 3: "Create a checkout page with shipping address form"

Step 4: "Add user authentication for checkout"

Step 5: "Create an order confirmation page"
```

## Be Specific About Design

### Vague (Unpredictable Results)

```
"Make a nice looking hero section"
```

### Specific (Consistent Results)

```
"Create a hero section with:
- Centered text layout
- Large heading (4xl) with gradient text from blue to purple
- Subheading in gray-600
- Two buttons: primary 'Get Started' and secondary 'Learn More'
- Background with subtle dots pattern"
```

## Reference Existing Elements

Instead of describing from scratch, reference what exists:

```
"Copy the card style from the features section and use it for the
testimonials section"
```

```
"Make this button match the primary button in the header"
```

```
"Use the same color scheme as the pricing cards"
```

## Use Technical Terms When You Know Them

If you know React/CSS/Tailwind terms, use them:

```
"Add a flex container with justify-between and items-center"
```

```
"Make this a server component that fetches data from Supabase"
```

```
"Add a useState hook to track the selected tab"
```

But if you don't know the terms, plain English works fine:

```
"Put these items side by side with space between them"
```

## Provide Examples

When you have something specific in mind:

```
"Create a pricing table similar to Stripe's pricing page, with
three tiers and a toggle for monthly/annual billing"
```

```
"Make the hover effect on these cards like Apple's product cards -
subtle lift and shadow"
```

## State Preferences Upfront

If you have styling preferences, mention them early:

```
"I prefer rounded corners, subtle shadows, and plenty of whitespace.
Create a dashboard layout with these preferences in mind."
```

## Handle Edge Cases

Think about what happens in different scenarios:

```
"Create a product list that:
- Shows a loading spinner while fetching
- Shows 'No products found' if the list is empty
- Shows an error message if the fetch fails"
```

## Iterate, Don't Start Over

Build on what you have:

### ❌ Starting Fresh

```
"That's wrong, make a completely different hero section"
```

### ✅ Iterating

```
"The hero is good but:
- Make the heading smaller
- Change the button color to blue
- Add more padding on mobile"
```

## Common Patterns

### Adding Pages

```
"Create a new page at /about with:
- Company story section
- Team member cards
- Office locations map"
```

### Database Integration

```
"Make this form save to a Supabase 'contacts' table with
fields: name, email, message, created_at"
```

### Authentication

```
"Add authentication:
- Login page at /login
- Signup page at /signup
- Protect the /dashboard route
- Add user menu in header when logged in"
```

### Responsive Design

```
"Make this layout:
- Single column on mobile
- Two columns on tablet
- Three columns on desktop"
```

## Prompting Patterns

### The "Create X with Y" Pattern

```
"Create [component] with [features/characteristics]"

Example: "Create a testimonial carousel with auto-play,
dots navigation, and quote cards"
```

### The "When X, Do Y" Pattern

```
"When [trigger], [action]"

Example: "When the user scrolls down 100px, make the
header background solid instead of transparent"
```

### The "Like X but Y" Pattern

```
"Make it like [reference] but [changes]"

Example: "Like the existing contact form but with
additional phone number and company fields"
```

## Quality Checklist

Before sending a complex prompt, check:

- [ ] Is the goal clear?
- [ ] Are all requirements specified?
- [ ] Did I mention any specific styling?
- [ ] Did I consider mobile/desktop?
- [ ] Did I reference existing elements if relevant?
- [ ] Is this small enough to succeed in one go?
