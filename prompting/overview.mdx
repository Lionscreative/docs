# Prompting Overview

The key to building great apps with Kleap is writing effective prompts. This guide will help you communicate clearly with the AI.

## The Basics

A prompt is simply a message describing what you want to build or change. The better your prompt, the better the result.

### Good Prompt Characteristics

  <Card title="Clear" icon="bullseye">
    State exactly what you want, not what you don't want
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specific" icon="list-check">
    Include details about styling, behavior, and placement
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contextual" icon="map">
    Reference existing elements or pages when relevant

    One task per prompt for best results

## Prompt Examples

### Creating Components

```
❌ Vague: "Add a header"

✅ Specific: "Add a header with the logo on the left, navigation
links (Home, Features, Pricing) in the center, and a 'Get Started'
button on the right"
```

### Styling Changes

```
❌ Vague: "Make it look better"

✅ Specific: "Change the background to a gradient from blue-500
to purple-600, increase the heading size, and add more spacing
between the cards"
```

### Adding Features

```
❌ Vague: "Add user accounts"

✅ Specific: "Add user authentication with email/password signup,
a login page, and protect the dashboard route so only logged-in
users can access it"
```

## Prompt Structure

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

### 1. Action

What you want to do (create, add, change, fix, remove)

### 2. Subject

What element or feature you're targeting

### 3. Details

Specific requirements, styling, or behavior

### Example

```
[Action] Create
[Subject] a pricing section
[Details] with three tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise), showing price,
features list, and a CTA button for each. Use a card layout with
the Pro tier highlighted.
```

## Using Element Selection

Click on elements in the preview to give the AI context:

1. **Click** the element you want to modify
2. **Type** your change request
3. AI knows exactly what you're referring to

```
[After selecting a button]
"Make this larger and change the text to 'Start Free Trial'"
```

This is often more effective than describing the element in text.

## Iteration

Building is iterative. Start simple and refine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with structure">
    "Create a landing page with a hero section, features, and footer"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add details">
    "Add three feature cards with icons to the features section"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine styling">
    "Make the hero background a gradient and increase the heading size"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add functionality">
    "Make the email signup form save to the database"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When Things Go Wrong

If the AI doesn't get it right:

1. **Clarify** - Rephrase with more detail
2. **Correct** - "That's not quite right, I wanted..."
3. **Undo** - Use version history if needed
4. **Break down** - Split complex requests into steps

## Credit Usage

Each prompt uses credits based on:

- Length of your message
- Complexity of the response
- Amount of code generated

<Tip>
  Concise, specific prompts are more credit-efficient than vague ones that require multiple iterations.
