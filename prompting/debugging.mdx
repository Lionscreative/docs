# Debugging with AI

When something goes wrong, Kleap's AI can help you fix it. Here's how to effectively debug issues.

## Types of Errors

### Build Errors

Happen when code can't compile:

- Syntax errors
- Missing imports
- Type errors
- Invalid JSX

**What you see**: Error message in the chat or preview

### Runtime Errors

Happen when the app runs:

- Undefined variables
- Failed API calls
- Null reference errors
- Logic bugs

**What you see**: Error in the preview or browser console

### Visual Bugs

The code works but doesn't look right:

- Wrong colors or sizing
- Broken layouts
- Missing elements
- Responsive issues

**What you see**: Unexpected appearance in preview

## Debugging Workflow

<Steps>

    Read the error message carefully. What does it say?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with AI">
    Paste the error message in chat
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide context">
    Explain what you were trying to do
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let AI fix it">
    AI will analyze and propose a fix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the fix">
    Check if the issue is resolved
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Effective Error Reporting

### Include the Error Message

```
I'm getting this error:
"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')"
on the products page
```

### Describe What Happened

```
I was trying to add a product list to the homepage.
The AI generated the code but now the page shows a white screen.
Here's the error from the console: [error message]
```

### Mention What Changed

```
After adding the user authentication, the dashboard page
stopped loading. It was working before that change.
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

### "Cannot find module"

```
Error: Cannot find module '@/components/Button'
```

**Causes**:
- Component doesn't exist
- Wrong import path
- Typo in filename

**Fix prompt**:
```
I'm getting a "Cannot find module '@/components/Button'" error.
Can you check if the file exists and fix the import?
```

### "Hydration mismatch"

```
Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match
what was rendered on the server
```

**Causes**:
- Different content on server vs client
- Using `window` or `localStorage` without checks
- Date/time rendering

**Fix prompt**:
```
I'm getting a hydration error on the dashboard.
Can you fix the component to avoid server/client mismatch?
```

### "X is not a function"

```
TypeError: supabase.from is not a function
```

**Causes**:
- Variable is not what you expect
- Wrong import
- Missing initialization

**Fix prompt**:
```
Getting "supabase.from is not a function" when trying
to fetch data. Can you check the Supabase setup?
```

### "Failed to fetch"

```
Error: Failed to fetch data from API
```

**Causes**:
- API endpoint doesn't exist
- CORS issues
- Network problems
- Wrong URL

**Fix prompt**:
```
The API call to /api/products is failing.
Can you check the API route and make sure it's set up correctly?
```

## Visual Debugging

When something looks wrong but there's no error:

### Describe What's Wrong

```
The cards are stacking vertically but I want them in a 3-column grid.
They also have no space between them.
```

### Reference What You Expected

```
The hero section should have the image on the right and text on
the left, but they're both centered in a column.
```

### Use Element Selection

1. Click the broken element
2. Describe what's wrong
3. AI has context to fix it

```
[After selecting element]
"This card is too narrow and the text is overflowing"
```

## When AI Can't Fix It

### Provide More Context

```
The error might be related to [your suspicion].
Here's the relevant code: [paste code]
```

### Try a Different Approach

```
The fix didn't work. Can we try a different approach?
Maybe [alternative solution]?
```

### Undo and Restart

If things are too broken:

1. Open version history
2. Restore to a working version
3. Try a different approach

```
Let's go back to the version before adding payments.
I want to try implementing it differently.
```

## Debugging Database Issues

### Connection Errors

```
Supabase connection failing. Can you verify:
1. Environment variables are set
2. Database URL is correct
3. The table exists
```

### Query Issues

```
This query returns empty but there's data in the table:
[your query]
Can you check the query and RLS policies?
```

### Auth Issues

```
User authentication isn't working. After signup, the user
doesn't stay logged in. Can you check the auth flow?
```

## Prevention Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test frequently">
    Don't wait until you've made many changes. Test after each significant addition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One change at a time">
    Make one change, verify it works, then move on. Easier to debug.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use version history">
    If something breaks badly, you can always roll back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Read error messages">
    Error messages often tell you exactly what's wrong. Share them with AI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Browser DevTools

For advanced debugging:

1. **Open DevTools** - Right-click → Inspect (or F12)
2. **Console tab** - See JavaScript errors
3. **Network tab** - Check API calls
4. **Elements tab** - Inspect HTML/CSS

Share what you find:

```
In the Network tab, the /api/users call returns 500.
The response body says: [error message]
```
