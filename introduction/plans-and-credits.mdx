## How Credits Work

### Credit Consumption

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Simple message (styling, text changes) | 1-3 credits |
| Medium complexity (new component, feature) | 5-15 credits |
| Complex request (full page, database setup) | 20-50 credits |

<Info>
  Credit cost depends on the complexity of your request and the AI's response length. Simple changes cost less.
