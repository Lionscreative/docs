## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can I build with Kleap?">
    You can build any web application including:
    - SaaS products and dashboards
    - E-commerce stores
    - Portfolios and personal websites
    - Blogs and content sites
    - Landing pages
    - Internal tools and admin panels

    Kleap uses Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, so any web app is possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code?">
    No! Kleap is designed for everyone. Simply describe what you want in plain language, and the AI generates the code. However, if you do know code, you can view and edit the source files directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who owns the code?">
    You do. 100%. Export to GitHub anytime, download the source files, or deploy anywhere you want. There's no lock-in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What technologies does Kleap use?">
    Apps are built with:
    - **Next.js 16** - React framework
    - **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
    - **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
    - **shadcn/ui** - Component library
    - **Supabase** - Database and auth
    - **Kleap Hosting** - Deployment and CDN
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preview & Sandbox

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did my preview stop?">
    The live preview automatically stops after **15 minutes of inactivity** to save resources. Simply send a new message or click refresh to restart it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between preview URL and production URL?">
    - **Preview URL** (`3000-xxx.proxy.daytona.works`): Temporary URL active while you're editing. Stops when inactive.
    - **Production URL** (`your-app.kleap.co`): Permanent URL after publishing. Always online.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I share the preview URL?">
    The preview URL is temporary and requires you to be logged in. For sharing, publish your app first.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing & Credits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do credits work?">
    Credits are consumed when you send messages to the AI. Simple requests cost 1-3 credits, complex requests can cost 20-50 credits. See [Plans & Credits](/introduction/plans-and-credits) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of credits?">
    Your apps stay online and functional. You just can't make new AI changes until you get more credits (daily refresh, upgrade, or purchase).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
    Yes, within 7 days if you've used less than 20% of your credits. Contact support@kleap.co.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Apps & Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many apps can I create?">
    You can create unlimited apps in the editor. However, there are limits on **published apps**: Free (3), Starter (10), Pro (50), Enterprise (unlimited).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is deployment free?">
    Yes. Publishing doesn't cost credits. Hosting is included with your Kleap account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain?">
    Yes. Connect any domain you own. Kleap handles SSL certificates automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my app?">
    Absolutely. Push to GitHub with one click, or download the source files. Your code is yours.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Database & Backend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to set up a database?">
    No setup required. When you ask for features that need data storage, Kleap automatically sets up Supabase (PostgreSQL database) for you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the database included in the price?">
    Supabase has a generous free tier that works for most apps. For high-traffic apps, you may need a paid Supabase plan (billed separately by Supabase).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I access my database directly?">
    Yes. You get full access to your Supabase dashboard, can run SQL queries, manage tables, and export data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my code secure?">
    Yes. Your code is stored securely and only accessible by you (and team members you invite). We don't share or sell your code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my apps secure?">
    Apps follow security best practices by default. However, always review sensitive features and enable proper authentication for production apps.
  </Accordion>
