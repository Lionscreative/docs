</Info>

## Step 2: Start Your App

You have two ways to begin:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From a Prompt">
    Describe what you want to build in the chat box:

    ```
    Create a task management app with:
    - User authentication
    - Ability to create, edit, and delete tasks
    - Due dates and priority levels
    - A clean, modern design
    ```

    The AI will generate your app based on your description.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From a Template">
    1. Click **Templates** in the sidebar
    2. Browse categories (SaaS, E-commerce, Portfolio, etc.)
    3. Click **Use Template** on your choice
    4. The template opens with all components ready
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Edit with AI

Once your app is created, continue the conversation to refine it:

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the header
```

```
Change the primary color to blue
```

```
Add a contact form to the footer
```

Each change updates your app in real-time in the preview panel.

  <img src="/images/kleap-interface.png" alt="Kleap interface showing AI chat and live preview" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Be specific in your requests. Instead of "make it better", try "increase the font size of headings and add more padding between sections".
</Tip>

## Step 4: Preview Your App

Your app runs in a live preview on the right side of the screen:

- **Real-time updates** as you make changes
- **Mobile responsive** - resize to test different screens
- **Interactive** - click buttons, fill forms, test functionality

<Warning>
  The preview auto-stops after 15 minutes of inactivity. Simply refresh or send a new message to restart it.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Publish Your App

When you're ready to go live:

1. Click the **Publish** button in the top bar
2. Wait for the build to complete (~30 seconds)
3. Your app is live at `your-app.kleap.co`

## Step 6: Connect a Custom Domain (Optional)

Want your own domain like `myapp.com`?

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions
5. SSL is automatically configured
